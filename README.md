# BMI-CALCULATOR

It is a user-friendly website designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) effortlessly. By inputting your height and weight, the website quickly computes your BMI, providing a simple and convenient way to monitor your health.


## Algorithm ⚙️

- Takes the Height in cm and weight in kg from the user.
- Divide the height by 100 to convert it from centimeters to meters. Then, square the height to get the value in square meters
- Divide the weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters to calculate BMI.
- Use conditional statements to categorize BMI values into different categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
